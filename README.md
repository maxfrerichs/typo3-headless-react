# typo3-headless-react

Headless frontend using the TYPO3 Headless API made with React and Tailwind CSS (still in development)

TODO:
* Implement TYPO3 content elements as React components
* Implement a page builder that creates and arranges React components from JSON data  
* Remove styling (?)
* Write some documentation ;)
